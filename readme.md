## Calculator Project Summary

### Key Points:

- **Functions to Create**: Develop functions for basic math operations (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`).
- **Variables**: Create variables to represent the first number, operator, and second number.
- **Operate Function**: Build a function that takes an operator and two numbers, then calls the relevant math function.
- **Basic Calculator UI**: Create the HTML structure for the calculator with buttons for digits, operations, and a display area.
- **Display Logic**: Write functions that update the display when numbers are clicked.
- **Calculator Operation**: Store the input numbers, apply the operator, and display the result when "=" is pressed.
- **Bugs to Watch Out For**:
  - Ensure the calculator only processes one pair of numbers at a time.
  - Round long decimal answers.
  - Handle cases where "=" is pressed without proper input.
  - The "clear" button should reset everything.
  - Include an error message for division by zero.

### Extra Credit:

- **Decimal Input**: Allow decimal input and prevent multiple decimals in a single number.
- **CSS Styling**: Improve the calculatorâ€™s appearance with CSS.
- **Backspace Button**: Add a "backspace" button for undoing incorrect inputs.
- **Keyboard Support**: Implement support for keyboard input.
- These features will be added soon
